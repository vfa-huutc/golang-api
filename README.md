# Golang Template Project

This is a Golang project designed to handle a simple web service with user management, roles, permissions, and refresh tokens. It uses MySQL for the database, Docker for containerization, and includes support for migrations, seeding, and authentication.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture and is organized into the following directories:

```

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (Go 1.23 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (Usually pre-installed on macOS and Linux)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Tools

Before doing anything else, install all required development tools using the following command:

```bash
# Install all required tools
make install-tools
```

This will install:
- Migrate CLI (for database migrations)
- Air (for live reloading)
- gocov and gocov-html (for test coverage reports)

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Build and run the application using Docker

You can use Docker Compose to set up both the app and the MySQL database:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the Docker images.
- Start a MySQL container.
- Start the application container.

### 4. Database Migrations

To create a new migration file, use the following command:

```bash
migrate create -ext sql -dir internal/database/migrations -seq your_migration_name
```

For example, to create a feedback table migration:
```bash
migrate create -ext sql -dir internal/database/migrations -seq feedback_table
```

This will create two files:
- XXXXXX_feedback_table.up.sql (for applying the migration)
- XXXXXX_feedback_table.down.sql (for reverting the migration)

The project includes migrations for creating the necessary tables in the MySQL database.
To apply the migrations:

```bash
migrate -path ./internal/database/migrations -database "mysql://root:root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/golang_db_2" up
```

To revert migrations, you can use the down command:

```bash
migrate -path ./internal/database/migrations -database "mysql://root:root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/golang_db_2" down
```

You can also revert a specific number of migrations by adding the number after the down command:

```bash
migrate -path ./internal/database/migrations -database "mysql://root:root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/golang_db_2" down 1
```

This will run the migration scripts and populate the database.

### 5. Seeding the Database

To seed the database with initial data (e.g., default users, roles, permissions), run:

```bash
go run cmd/seeder/seeder.go
```

### 6. Running the Server

The easiest way to run the server is using the provided make command:

```bash
make start-server
```

This command will:
1. Install required tools (if not already installed)
2. Start Docker containers in detached mode
3. Start the server with Air for live reloading

Alternatively, you can run the server in other ways:

#### Using Air Directly

[Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) provides live-reloading capability which is great for development:

```bash
air
```

#### Direct Go Run

If you prefer to run the server directly without live-reloading:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start and be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 7. phpmyadmin

PHPMyAdmin is available for database management through a web interface at:
- URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the application:

Database Configuration:
- `DB_HOST` - MySQL database host
- `DB_USERNAME` - MySQL database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - MySQL database password
- `DB_DATABASE` - MySQL database name
- `DB_PORT` - MySQL port number

JWT Configuration:
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for JWT token generation
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - JWT token expiration time (e.g., "24h")

Server Configuration:
- `SERVER_PORT` - Port number for the application server (default: 3000)
- `SERVER_MODE` - Server mode ("development" or "production")

Mail Configuration (if using email features):
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server host
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port
- `SMTP_USERNAME` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP password
- `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` - Email address used as sender

Redis Configuration (for caching and session management):
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis server host
- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis server port
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password (if any)

These can be set in the `.env` file or passed directly as environment variables. A sample `.env.example` file is provided in the repository.

Check the `docs/api_spec.md` for a detailed API specification.

## Testing

To install required testing tools and run tests with coverage report generation:

```bash
make test-coverage
```

This command will:
1. Install required tools (gocov and gocov-html) if not already installed
2. Run all tests and generate coverage.json
3. Generate an HTML coverage report at coverage.html

For specific tests, you can still use:

```bash
go test -v path/to/test
```

### Unit Tests Directory

The test files are located under the `tests` directory. The tests follow the Go testing conventions.

## Contribution Guidelines

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/feature-name`).
